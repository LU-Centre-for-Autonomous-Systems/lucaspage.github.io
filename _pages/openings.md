PhD programs are opening later this year, get in touch if you are interested in working on AI problems for medical imaging and computational neuroscience.

[AI-driven simulations of brain development](https://kcl-mrcdtp.com/project/ai-driven-simulations-of-brain-development/) Combining computational neuroscience with biomedical engineering we will build simulations of neurological processes and use these to predict which babies are most at risk of neurodevelopmental disorders

[Commonwealth PhD Scholarships for the least developed countries and fragile states](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/study-legacy/funding/commonwealth-phd-scholarships-for-least-developed-countries-and-fragile-states) if you think this applies to you get in touch
