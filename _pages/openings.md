# Open positions

3 Year Research Associate position in [Deep Learning driven surface to volume brain registration](https://my.corehr.com/pls/kingrecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.display_form?p_company=1&p_internal_external=E&p_display_in_irish=N&p_process_type=&p_applicant_no=&p_form_profile_detail=&p_display_apply_ind=Y&p_refresh_search=Y&p_recruitment_id=024287)

### Current open positions

Coming soon...

### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions

Interesting in developing novel algorithms for:
- Deep Learning on surface meshes
- Making predictions from data which changes both in space AND time
Then consider this CDT project supervised by Dr Emma Robinson and Prof Daniel Rueckert from Imperial College London [Deep Learning prediction of brain states from fMRI](https://www.imagingcdt.com/project/reading-minds-with-deep-learning-predicting-behavioural-states-from-functional-imaging-data/)

What about developing Deep Generative models of brain structure and function? Consider applying for Dr Jonathan O'Muircheartaigh and Dr Robinson's CDT project on [detecting-neurological-disease-through-deep-generative-modelling-of-the-developing-brain](https://www.imagingcdt.com/project/detecting-neurological-disease-through-deep-generative-modelling-of-the-developing-brain/)
