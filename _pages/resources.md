## Group Tutorials

We run tutorials on a variety of topics including machine learning, medical image processing and foundation neuroscience. Below are links to slides and notebooks:

[Methods for diffusion MRI analysis in recent neonate studies](https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/k1759240_kcl_ac_uk/EYrpr6GOaExMqlHzPhqcAV4BOwzeIe-aNHNYpvCmS9yn8Q?e=4FPZof)

[Capsule networks]({{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/Capsules_tutorial.pdf)

[Gaussian Processes models in developmental neuroimagingâ€‹](https://github.com/metrics-lab/talks_and_tutorials/blob/master/GaussianProcessModels_in_Developmentalneuroimaging.pdf)

[Cortical surface mesh modelling and fMRI analysis](https://github.com/metrics-lab/talks_and_tutorials/blob/master/cortical_surface_imaging_and_fMRI_analysis.pdf)

[Using Animal Models in Perinatal Brain Research](https://github.com/metrics-lab/talks_and_tutorials/blob/master/Animal_Models_Of_Perinatal_Research%20%2B%20Preclinical_Imaging%20-%20Sept2019.pdf)

## Software

Here is a list of open source softwares:

- [MSM](https://github.com/ecr05/MSM_HOCR) - a tool for multimodal alignment of cortical surface data. This is the image registration software used by the [Human Connectome Project (HCP) pipelines](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/hcp-mr-pipelines) and in the [HCP parcellation paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/doi%3A10.1038/nature18933)

- [dHCP surface to template alignment](https://github.com/ecr05/dHCP_template_alignment) - scripts to align neonatal cortical surfaces to the neonatal surface templates [available here](https://brain-development.org/brain-atlases/atlases-from-the-dhcp-project/)

- Pipelines for Neonatal cortical surface extraction are available from the [developing Human Connectome Project (dHCP) github ](https://github.com/DevelopingHCP)

- [SVRTK](https://github.com/SVRTK) - [MIRTK](https://github.com/BioMedIA/MIRTK) based SVR reconstruction
