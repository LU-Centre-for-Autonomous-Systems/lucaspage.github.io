# Research

### Dr. Emma Robinson
<div markdown style="text-align: justify">
Dr Robinson's research focuses on the development of computational methods for brain imaging analysis,  and covers a wide range of image processing and machine learning topics. Most notably, her software for cortical surface registration [Multimodal Surface Matching](https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/MSM) (MSM) has been central to the development of the Human Connectome Project’s [Multimodal parcellation of the human cortex](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18933), and has featured as a central tenet in the [HCP’s paradigm for neuroimage analysis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.4361). This work has been widely reported in the media including Wired, Scientific American, and Wall Street Journal. 

Current research interests are focused on the application of advanced machine learning, and particularly deep learning to diverse data sets combining multi-modality imaging data with genetic samples. We are particularly interested in building sensitive models of cognitive development and developmental outcome for prematurely born babies from data collected for the [Developing Human Connectome](http://www.developingconnectome.org/project/) Project (dHCP).
